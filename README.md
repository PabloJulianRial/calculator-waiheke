## SPACE CALCULATOR
## Welcome to my calculator project
I created this calculator app using TypeScript and SCSS as part of my _Nology training.
The calculator in it's simplest form, for phones and tablets, can perform all operations of a regular calculator.
For larger screens I added some extra functionality (for experts only).
Try not to get dizzy with the rolling-space background image.

If you match the result to the secret number, you can take a ride in the rocket.

3, 3-1, 3-2, null, BLAST OFF!
